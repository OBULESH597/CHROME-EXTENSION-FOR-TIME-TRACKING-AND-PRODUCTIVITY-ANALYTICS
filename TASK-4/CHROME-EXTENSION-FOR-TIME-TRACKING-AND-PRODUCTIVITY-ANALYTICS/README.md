The final task involved building a Chrome extension that tracks the time spent on different websites and classifies them as productive or unproductive. The extension was developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. HTML and CSS were used to design the extension's user interface, including its popup and options page, which allowed users to interact with the extension. The core functionality was implemented using JavaScript, which interacted with the browser's tabs API to monitor which websites were being visited. Chrome's Storage API (specifically, chrome.storage.local) was used to persist user data such as the time spent on each website. The extension also used Event Listeners to detect when a user switched tabs, when a new tab was opened, or when the user navigated to a different website, allowing the extension to track and record these activities. For categorizing websites as productive or unproductive, a basic logic could be applied based on predefined lists or user input. The background script of the extension was implemented using Manifest V3, and Service Workers were utilized for managing the extension's background processes. The extension tracked time spent on websites and displayed it in a simple dashboard, where users could view their productivity statistics. This dashboard was dynamically updated using JavaScript, and the time tracking data was stored in Chrome's local storage to persist even if the browser was closed and reopened.
